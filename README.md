# formula explanation:
# p(at least 1 win) = 1-(1-p)^n 
# (1-p)^n = probability of loosing every time, where 1-p is the probabilty of loosing, and the ^n represents the # of times, aka "every" time 
# 1- for the probability because we are looking for the complement of the situation where we every single one is loss
