# Probabilites of certain outcomes for gacha games using math

In the situation of a gacha game, we are looking for the probability of finding a rare item, and the formula for probabiltiy of finding at least 1 win is a good model to demonstrate this. p(at least 1 win) = 1-(1-p)^n 
/(1-p)^n = probability of loosing every time, where 1-p is the probabilty of loosing, and the ^n represents the # of times or trials, aka "every" time  n will represent the amount of "rolls" in a gacha game
/1- for the probability because we are looking for the complement of the situation where we every single one is loss, i.e the situation where we win at least one time in the given number of rolls.
